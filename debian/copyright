 The NCursesWindow class was originally based on a file written by
 Eric Newton, later modified by Ulrich Drepper and Anatoly Ivasyuk.
 However, aside from the compatible interface definition, no trace
 of the original code remains in this version: it consists only of
 changes introduced since 1995.

 The XSI Curses standard requires all curses entry points to exist as
 functions, even though many definitions would normally be shadowed
 by macros.  Rather than hand-hack all that code, we actually
 generate functions from the macros.
 .
 This script accepts a file of prototypes on standard input.  It discards
 any that don't have a `generated' comment attached. It then parses each
 prototype (relying on the fact that none of the macros take function
 pointer or array arguments) and generates C source from it.
 .
 Here is what the pipeline stages are doing:
 .
 1. sed: extract prototypes of generated functions
 2. sed: decorate prototypes with generated arguments a1. a2,...z
 3. awk: generate the calls with args matching the formals
 4. sed: prefix function names in prototypes so the preprocessor won't expand
 them.
 5. cpp: macro-expand the file so the macro calls turn into C calls
 6. awk: strip the expansion junk off the front and add the new header

 Demonstrate a method for altering key definitions at runtime.

 This program reads the key definitions, merging those which have xterm-style
 modifiers into their equivalents which have no modifiers.  It does this
 merging only for the keys which are defined in the terminal description.

 This script takes terminfo.head and terminfo.tail and splices in between
 them a table derived from the Caps data file.  Besides avoiding having
 the docs fall out of sync with the table, this also lets us set up tbl
 commands for better formatting of the table.
 .
 NOTE: The s in this script really are control characters.  It translates
  to \n because I couldn't get used to inserting linefeeds directly.  There
 had better be no s in the table source text.

 This is an adaptation of ncurses' termcap/terminfo capability table, which
 is designed to align with OSF/1 version 5 (Tru64) terminfo.
 .
 This table is used to generate initializers for tables that drive tic,
 infocmp, and the library compilation code used to support the termcap
 compatibility hack.  It is also used to generate the tabular portion of the
 terminfo(5) man page; lines beginning with `#%' are passed through to become
 the terminfo table.
 .
 This file has three major sections; a standard-capabilities table, two
 extension-capability tables, and a section of aliases declarations.
 The first two have the same format, as follows:

 An example of the 'filter()' function in ncurses, this program prompts
 for commands and executes them (like a command shell).  It illustrates

 this program 'bleed' onto the executed commands.  Rather than use the

 Work around incompatible behavior introduced with gnat6, which causes
 gnatmake to attempt to compile all of the C objects which might be part of
 the project.  This can only work if we provide the compiler flags (done here
 by making a copy of the project file with that information filled in).

 This is an adaptation of ncurses' termcap/terminfo capability table, which
 is designed to align with U/Win's terminfo.
 .
 This table is used to generate initializers for tables that drive tic,
 infocmp, and the library compilation code used to support the termcap
 compatibility hack.  It is also used to generate the tabular portion of the
 terminfo(5) man page; lines beginning with `#%' are passed through to become
 the terminfo table.
 .
 This file has three major sections; a standard-capabilities table, two
 extension-capability tables, and a section of aliases declarations.
 The first two have the same format, as follows:
 .
 FILE FORMAT
 .
 Column 1: terminfo variable name
 Column 2: terminfo capability name
 Column 3: capability type (boolean, numeric, or string)
 Column 4: termcap capability name

 suffix rules (to force compilation with the appropriate flags).  We could use
 make-recursion but that would result in makefiles that are useless for
 development.

 This is a simple configuration-script for the ncurses test programs that
 allows the test-directory to be separately configured against a reference
 system (i.e., sysvr4 curses)
 .
 If you're configuring ncurses, you shouldn't need to use this script.
 It's only for testing purposes.

 This module is intended to encapsulate ncurses's interface to pointing
 devices.
 .
 The primary method used is xterm's internal mouse-tracking facility.
 Additional methods depend on the platform:
 Alessandro Rubini's GPM server (Linux)
 sysmouse (FreeBSD)
 special-purpose mouse interface for OS/2 EMX.
 .
 Notes for implementors of new mouse-interface methods:
 .
 The code is logically split into a lower level that accepts event reports
 in a device-dependent format and an upper level that parses mouse gestures
 and filters events.  The mediating data structure is a circular queue of
 MEVENT structures.
 .
 Functionally, the lower level's job is to pick up primitive events and
 put them on the circular queue.  This can happen in one of two ways:

 This is an extension to the curses library.  It provides callers with a hook
 into the NCURSES data to resize windows, primarily for use by programs
 running in an X Window terminal (e.g., xterm).  I abstracted this module
 from my application library for NCURSES because it must be compiled with
 the private data structures -- T.Dickey 1995/7/4.

 binding.  Ongoing  work  is  being done by Thomas Dickey (maintainer).
 Contact the current maintainers at bug-ncurses@gnu.org.
 .
 This  document  also describes the panels extension library, similarly
 modeled  on  the  SVr4  panels  facility.  This  library allows you to
 associate  backing  store  with each of a stack or deck of overlapping
 windows,  and  provides  operations  for  moving windows around in the
 stack that change their visibility in the natural way (handling window
 overlaps).
 .
 Finally,  this  document  describes  in  detail  the  menus  and forms
 extension  libraries,  also  cloned  from System V, which support easy
 construction and sequences of menus and fill-in forms.
 .
 Terminology
 .
 In  this  document,  the following terminology is used with reasonable
 consistency:
 .
 window
 A  data  structure  describing  a  sub-rectangle  of the screen
 (possibly  the  entire  screen).  You  can write to a window as
 though  it  were a miniature screen, scrolling independently of
 other windows on the physical screen.
 .
 screens
 A  subset of windows which are as large as the terminal screen,
 i.e.,  they  start  at the upper left hand corner and encompass
 the   lower  right  hand  corner.  One  of  these,  stdscr,  is
 automatically provided for the programmer.
 .
 terminal screen
 The package's idea of what the terminal display currently looks
 like, i.e., what the user sees now. This is a special screen.
 .
 The Curses Library
 .
 An Overview of Curses
 .
 Compiling Programs using Curses
 .
 In order to use the library, it is necessary to have certain types and
 variables defined. Therefore, the programmer must have a line:
 #include <curses.h>
 .
 at the top of the program source. The screen package uses the Standard
 I/O   library,  so  <curses.h>  includes  <stdio.h>.  <curses.h>  also
 includes  <termios.h>,  <termio.h>,  or  <sgtty.h>  depending  on your
 system.  It is redundant (but harmless) for the programmer to do these
 includes,  too.  In  linking with curses you need to have -lncurses in
 your  LDFLAGS  or  on the command line. There is no need for any other
 libraries.
 .
 Updating the Screen
 .
 In  order  to  update  the  screen  optimally, it is necessary for the
 routines  to  know  what  the screen currently looks like and what the
 programmer  wants  it to look like next. For this purpose, a data type
 (structure)  named WINDOW is defined which describes a window image to
 the  routines,  including its starting position on the screen (the (y,
 x)  coordinates  of  the  upper left hand corner) and its size. One of
 these  (called  curscr,  for current screen) is a screen image of what
 the  terminal currently looks like. Another screen (called stdscr, for
 standard screen) is provided by default to make changes on.
 .
 A  window is a purely internal representation. It is used to build and
 store a potential image of a portion of the terminal. It does not bear
 any necessary relation to what is really on the terminal screen; it is
 more like a scratchpad or write buffer.
 .
 To  make  the  section  of  physical  screen corresponding to a window
 reflect  the  contents  of the window structure, the routine refresh()
 (or wrefresh() if the window is not stdscr) is called.
 .
 A  given physical screen section may be within the scope of any number
 of  overlapping  windows.  Also, changes can be made to windows in any
 order,  without  regard  to  motion  efficiency.  Then,  at  will, the
 programmer  can  effectively say "make it look like this," and let the
 package implementation determine the most efficient way to repaint the
 screen.
 .
 Standard Windows and Function Naming Conventions
 .
 As  hinted  above,  the  routines can use several windows, but two are
 automatically given: curscr, which knows what the terminal looks like,
 and  stdscr,  which  is what the programmer wants the terminal to look
 like  next.  The  user  should  never actually access curscr directly.
 Changes  should  be  made  to  through  the  API, and then the routine
 refresh() (or wrefresh()) called.
 .
 Many  functions  are  defined  to  use stdscr as a default screen. For
 example,  to  add  a  character  to stdscr, one calls addch() with the
 desired character as argument. To write to a different window. use the
 routine  waddch()  (for  window-specific  addch())  is  provided. This
 convention of prepending function names with a "w" when they are to be
 applied  to specific windows is consistent. The only routines which do
 not follow it are those for which a window must always be specified.
 .
 In  order  to  move  the  current (y, x) coordinates from one point to
 another,  the routines move() and wmove() are provided. However, it is
 often  desirable to first move and then perform some I/O operation. In
 order  to  avoid  clumsiness, most I/O routines can be preceded by the
 prefix  "mv"  and  the  desired  (y,  x)  coordinates prepended to the
 arguments to the function. For example, the calls
 move(y, x);
 addch(ch);
 .
 can be replaced by
 mvaddch(y, x, ch);
 .
 and
 wmove(win, y, x);
 waddch(win, ch);
 .
 can be replaced by
 mvwaddch(win, y, x, ch);
 .
 Note  that the window description pointer (win) comes before the added
 (y,  x)  coordinates.  If  a function requires a window pointer, it is
 always the first parameter passed.
 .
 Variables
 .
 The  curses  library  sets  some  variables  describing  the  terminal
 capabilities.

 This is an adaptation of ncurses' termcap/terminfo capability table, which
 is designed to align with HPUX 11.x's terminfo.
 .
 This table is used to generate initializers for tables that drive tic,
 infocmp, and the library compilation code used to support the termcap
 compatibility hack.  It is also used to generate the tabular portion of the
 terminfo(5) man page; lines beginning with `#%' are passed through to become
 the terminfo table.
 .
 This file has three major sections; a standard-capabilities table, two
 extension-capability tables, and a section of aliases declarations.
 The first two have the same format, as follows:
 .
 FILE FORMAT
 .
 Column 1: terminfo variable name
 Column 2: terminfo capability name
 Column 3: capability type (boolean, numeric, or string)
 Column 4: termcap capability name

 A very simple script to list all entrypoints that are used by either a test
 program, or within the libraries.  This relies on the output format of 'nm',
 and assumes that the libraries are configured with TRACE defined, and using
 these options:
 --disable-macros
 --enable-opaque-curses
 --enable-sp-funcs
 --enable-widec
 --without-gpm
 Static libraries are used, to provide some filtering based on internal usage
 of the different symbols.
 .
 keep the sorting independent of locale:

 vidputs(newmode, outc)
 .
 newmode is taken to be the logical 'or' of the symbols in curses.h
 representing graphic renditions.  The terminal is set to be in all of
 the given modes, if possible.
 .
 if the new attribute is normal
 if exit-alt-char-set exists
 emit it
 emit exit-attribute-mode
 else if set-attributes exists
 use it to set exactly what you want
 else
 if exit-attribute-mode exists
 turn off everything
 else
 turn off those which can be turned off and aren't in
 newmode.
 turn on each mode which should be on and isn't, one by one
 .
 NOTE that this algorithm won't achieve the desired mix of attributes
 in some cases, but those are probably just those cases in which it is
 actually impossible, anyway, so...
 .
 NOTE that we cannot assume that there's no interaction between color
 and other attribute resets.  So each time we reset color (or other
 attributes) we'll have to be prepared to restore the other.

 Some of the ".dat" files in ncurses' test-directory give r/g/b numbers for
 default palettes of xterm and Linux console.  This script reads the numbers
 and (assuming the same or compatible terminal) uses tput to (re)initialize
 the palette using those numbers.

 view.c -- a silly little viewer program
 .
 written by Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> December 1994
 to test the scrolling code in ncurses.
 .
 modified by Thomas Dickey <dickey@clark.net> July 1995 to demonstrate
 the use of 'resizeterm()', and May 2000 to illustrate wide-character
 handling.  This program intentionally does not use pads, to allow testing
 with less-capable implementations of curses.
 .
 Takes a filename argument.  It's a simple file-viewer with various
 scroll-up and scroll-down commands.
 .
 n	-- scroll one line forward
 p	-- scroll one line back
 .
 Either command accepts a numeric prefix interpreted as a repeat count.
 Thus, typing `5n' should scroll forward 5 lines in the file.
 .
 The way you can tell this is working OK is that, in the trace file,
 there should be one scroll operation plus a small number of line
 updates, as opposed to a whole-page update.  This means the physical
 scroll operation worked, and the refresh() code only had to do a
 partial repaint.

 This is the master termcap/terminfo capability table.
 .
 This table is used to generate initializers for tables that drive tic,
 infocmp, and the library compilation code used to support the termcap
 compatibility hack.  It is also used to generate the tabular portion of the
 terminfo(5) man page; lines beginning with `#%' are passed through to become
 the terminfo table.
 .
 This file has three major sections; a standard-capabilities table, two
 extension-capability tables, and a section of aliases declarations.
 The first two have the same format, as follows:
 .

 The complete configure script for ncurses is the ncurses5-config (or similar
 name, depending on the flavor, e.g., ncursesw5-config, ncurses6-config, etc).
 That provides more information than pkg-config, and is the portable and
 recommended solution.
 .
 For each library, generate a ".pc" file which depends on the base ncurses
 library, except that the tinfo library does not depend on ncurses.

 This illustrates the predefined colors for XFree86 xterm's "xterm-16color".
 If you set $TERM to "xterm-88color" (and have xterm compiled to support the

 This is an adaptation of ncurses' termcap/terminfo capability table, which
 is illustrates an experimental extension to describe alt-, shift- and
 control-modifiers applied to function and normal keys, as done on IBM pc's.
 .
 This table is used to generate initializers for tables that drive tic,
 infocmp, and the library compilation code used to support the termcap
 compatibility hack.  It is also used to generate the tabular portion of the
 terminfo(5) man page; lines beginning with `#%' are passed through to become
 the terminfo table.
 .
 This file has three major sections; a standard-capabilities table, two
 extension-capability tables, and a section of aliases declarations.
 The first two have the same format, as follows:
 .

 Column 1: terminfo variable name
 Column 2: terminfo capability name
 Column 3: capability type (boolean, numeric, or string)
 Column 4: termcap capability name

 System-dependent wrapper for 'lint' that creates a lint-library via the
 following method (XXX is the name of the library):
 a.  If the file llib-lXXX doesn't exist, create it using the make-rule
 b.  Process llib-lXXX with the system's lint utility, making
 llib-lXXX.ln
 c.  Install llib-lXXX.ln in the lib directory.
 .
 Using the intermediate file llib-lXXX bypasses a weakness of lint (passing
 through warning messages from the original source-files).
 .
 There are two drawbacks to this approach:
 a.  On a few systems, you'll have to manually-edit the llib-lXXX file
 to get a usable lint-library (not all C-preprocessors work well).
 b.  The system's lint utility won't recognize -lXXX as a lint-library
 (Use tdlint as a wrapper; it is designed for this).
 .

 Notes:
 The initial adaptation from 4.4BSD Lite sources in September 1995 used 686
 lines from that version, and made changes/additions for 150 lines.  There
 was no reformatting, so with/without ignoring whitespace, the amount of
 change is the same.
 .
 Comparing with current (2009) source, excluding this comment:
 a) 209 lines match identically to the 4.4BSD Lite sources, with 771 lines
 changed/added.
 a) Ignoring whitespace, the current version still uses 516 lines from the
 4.4BSD Lite sources, with 402 lines changed/added.
 .
